+cache
-Memcache 
Memcached is an in-memory key-value store for small chunks of arbitrary data (strings, objects) 
from results of database calls, API calls, or page rendering.

-Solr
Solr is highly reliable, scalable and fault tolerant, providing distributed indexing, 
replication and load-balanced querying, automated failover and recovery, 
centralized configuration and more. Solr powers the search and navigation 
features of many of the world's largest internet sites. 

+database-memory
-Redis
Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as database, 
cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, 
sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs and geospatial indexes with radius queries. 
Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions and different levels of
on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.
